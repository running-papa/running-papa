# Hello! I'm a Developer using AWS! üë©‚Äçüíª

## Introduction
Hello! I'm a backend developer using Node.js and NestJS. 
I also enjoy frontend development using Vue.js and React. 
Recently, I've been working on projects involving IoT-based backend servers, gaining diverse experiences along the way.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Node.js, NestJS
- **Frontend:** Vue.js, React
- **Database:** Amazon RDS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- **Object Storage:** Amazon S3
- **Access Management:** AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

## Development with AWS
### Server Deployment
I currently deploy servers using AWS Elastic Beanstalk and EC2. Elastic Beanstalk provides a straightforward and scalable infrastructure for easy management.

### Domain Management
Domain management is handled through Amazon Route 53, providing flexible domain setup and management for a stable service.

### Database
Amazon RDS is utilized to easily manage databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL. RDS was chosen for its scalability and reliability.

### Object Storage
Amazon S3 is used for storing and distributing static assets such as images and videos. It offers a reliable and scalable object storage solution with excellent performance.

### Access Management
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is employed to finely control access to each service and resource. This enhances security and facilitates smooth collaboration between development and operations teams.
